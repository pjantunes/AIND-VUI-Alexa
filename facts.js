        "The field of AI is considered to have its origin in 1950, with publication of British mathematician Alan Turing's paper, Computing Machinery and Intelligence.",
        "The term, Artificial Intelligence, was coined in 1956 by mathematician and computer scientist John McCarthy, at Dartmouth College, in New Hampshire.",
        "In 1997, a chess-playing program named Deep Blue, developed by IBM, beat the reigning world chess champion.",
        "A so-called AI Winter occurred in 1974, when funding was cut after Speech Understanding research did not live up to its promise.",
        "A driverless robotic car named Stanley, engineered by Sebastian Thrun's Stanford Racing team, sped through the Mojave desert at 22 miles per hour to win the 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge.",
        "In 1950 Alan Turing published a landmark paper in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think.",
        "In 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess.",
        "The field of artificial intelligence research was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.",
        "In 1955, Allen Newell and (future Nobel Laureate) Herbert A. Simon created the 'Logic Theorist' (with help from J. C. Shaw). The program would eventually prove 38 of the first 52 theorems in Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, and find new and more elegant proofs for some. Simon said that they had solved the venerable mind/body problem, explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of mind.",
        "The Dartmouth Conference of 1956[39] was organized by Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and two senior scientists: Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM. The proposal for the conference included this assertion: 'every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it'",
    	"In June 1963, MIT received a $2.2 million grant from the newly created Advanced Research Projects Agency (later known as DARPA).",
    	"In Japan, Waseda University initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale intelligent humanoid robot, or android."
